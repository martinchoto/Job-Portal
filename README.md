# Job-Portal
ASP.NET App for the defence project at SoftUni
You can register as a company or applicant, companies can create, edit, delete job offers and applicants can apply to them with applications they can only create. If they are interested in you they can contact you using email. Companies can also create fun events for their companies examples are shooting events or food events. Applicants can join them and be reminded when the event is.
This is just a simple app for a student, not really professional web app. Used ASP.NET, EF Core, Boostrap, Jquery and SQL Server.
